This is a "juicy" game of breakout. The player is able to move a paddle horizontally with their mouse and they can try to bounce the ball off the paddle and into the bricks. If the ball falls off the screen three times then the game is over. 

I tried to make this game juicier by making the paddle tween onto the screen. I added some space themed visuals to make the environment more interesting for players. I am currently trying to add sound effects and background music! Please check back in if you're interested in an updated version (hopefully I figure this out sooner than later).

I am trying to figure out how to add levels and get the tiles to tween onto the screen without having to ditch all of the various colors. I know that my "juicy" game isn't all that impressive, but I am hoping to update it while I work out the bugs and get some help on making it a more interactive game with interesting components.
